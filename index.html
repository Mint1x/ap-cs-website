            <p>Boys day is an app I am currently working on which will help the male gender find activities to do with other males. A current problem I see is people not getting out enough especially with covid. This app is intended to make new friendships which were destroyed during quarantine. The app will show activities available in your current location and other people looking for activities you might be interested in. the app is similar to tinder but instead of relationships it's encouraging friendships</p>

            <p>We are learning how to program with Snap! The Programming language. In the example, we made a program with a number guessing game that tells you if youâ€™re too low or too high until you guess the right answer. The code was complicated and required us to check multiple times to make sure the code was full proof.</p>

            <p>I recently took a digital media class in which I learned many ways to edit my photos. We explored photoshop and learned cool techniques to use later on in life. I enjoyed learning how to edit photos and might seek this a career option in the future</p>
